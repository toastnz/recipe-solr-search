[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-search)

This includes the following core SilverStripe and CWP modules:

 * [silverstripe/recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms): Recipe containing CMS, versioned, asset-admin, etc
 * [cwp/cwp-recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-cms): CWP CMS requirements recipe
 * [cwp/cwp-search](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-search): CWP fulltextsearch integration module
 * [silverstripe/fulltextsearch](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-fulltextsearch): Adds external full text
   search engine support to SilverStripe, specically with Solr in a CWP context
 * [symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs): A module that provides
   interfaces for scheduling jobs for certain times

This can be either added to an existing project or used as a project base for creating a basic CWP install.
